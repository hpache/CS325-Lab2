Class: CS325, January 2022
Lab: 01
Due: 4 January 2022

For this project I used the nav, span, script, and iframe tags. I used the nav tag to create a navigation
bar which will allow people to switch between my resume and my research experience. The span and script tags
were used to create an element within the research.html txt that will give the current local time and date.
The span tag was to keep the text in the same line, and the scrip tag was used to create the javascript
code that will keep track of the time by checking them every second and updating the text appropriately.
Finally the iframe tag was used to show a preview of my thesis as opposed to having a google drive link
which would redirect the user to a different page. The use of the iframe tag also lets the user download
the pdf from the page as opposed to redirecting them to an external page.
